# chaos-ids

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

The purpose of this project is to make security as easy as possible. The tools to enforce security policy, monitor networks,
enforce compliance etc already exist. But they require a high degree of expertise to setup and use. The purpose of this
tool is to make it as easy as possible to deploy said tools and configure them correctly. For now, I am focusing on IDS systems
and getting them deployed and configured correctly to maximize security posture. Ultimately, I hope to turn it into an all in one configuration management and IDS tool.
